## Scrabble
Play scrabble with friends on your local network

* Still in dev.
* Please see the [DevFlow](DevFlow.md) file for issues I'm fixing.$

### Requirements
- A laptop, or any device that allows dragging with a mouse.
- Development was tailored towards laptops, as they fully support the [HTML5 Draggable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) API, unlike mobile devices or tablets.

### Usage
**You'll need to checkout the `uat` branch to test. Please note that the gameplay itself is still in develpoment**
